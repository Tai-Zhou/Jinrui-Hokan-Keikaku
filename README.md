This repository is an [Evangelion (エヴァンゲリオン)](https://www.evangelion.co.jp) style `typst` & `TeX` cover page template.

## Engine & Compiler
### Typst
[Typst](https://typst.app/home/) is a new markup-based typesetting system for the sciences. It previews your changes instantly and provides clear, understandable error messages. It is written in `rust` and extremely fast.


### XeTeX

XeTeX (/ˈziːtɛx/ ZEE-tekh or /ˈziːtɛk/; see also Pronouncing and writing "TeX") is a TeX typesetting engine using Unicode and supporting modern font technologies such as OpenType, Graphite and Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX).

### XeLaTeX

The corresponding compiler is XeLaTeX, which is **needed** here. For more information, you may read this article by Overleaf: [What's in a Name: A Guide to the Many Flavours of TeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/What's_in_a_Name:_A_Guide_to_the_Many_Flavours_of_TeX).

## Font

`Matisse Pro` is needed, you can find related information from [Fontworks](https://fontworks.co.jp/column/394/), and preview the font at [FONTPLUS](https://fontplus.jp/font-list/matissepro-b). A new version (`Matisse ProN`) is also provided at [Adobe](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/fot-matisse-pron).
