## Engine & Compiler
### XeTeX

XeTeX (/ˈziːtɛx/ ZEE-tekh or /ˈziːtɛk/; see also Pronouncing and writing "TeX") is a TeX typesetting engine using Unicode and supporting modern font technologies such as OpenType, Graphite and Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX).

### XeLaTeX

The corresponding compiler is XeLaTeX, which is **needed** here. For more information, you may read this article by Overleaf: [What's in a Name: A Guide to the Many Flavours of TeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/What's_in_a_Name:_A_Guide_to_the_Many_Flavours_of_TeX).
